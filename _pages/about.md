I am a PostDoc in the <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/ari/forschung/biologie/laufende-projekte/decoding-elephant-communication-with-ai-mathematics-ml-team">ELECOM project</a> at the Acoustics Research Institute in Vienna, where we develop machine learning algorithms with the aim of providing insights into the communication of African Savanna Elephants.

In my PhD, I developed frame-theoretic approaches to study the stability and invertibility of neural networks and proposed architecture designs and regularizers to guarantee stable invertibility with a particular focus on audio applications.

If you are interested in the topic, I will be happy if you drop me a line &#129305;
